            <p>Peru is a country full of life, where ancient traditions meet modern influences. Its food, like ceviche and lomo saltado, is bold and flavorful. Football is a national passion, with fans cheering their team with pride. The music ranges from Andean melodies with flutes and guitars to energetic Afro-Peruvian beats. Peru's culture is alive in its festivals, colorful textiles, and warm, welcoming people.</p>
